# Repo for papers relating to GraphZ

### Wait... This is in LaTeX. I want word?.
There is a word doc 'mirror' of the papers as well. If anyone edits this, I will use pandoc (a converter script) to sync up changes with the original document. Don't worry if it looks wrong (wrong font, etc) as the LaTeX one looks right (and will be turned in).
