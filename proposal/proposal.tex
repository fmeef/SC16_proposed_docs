\begin{abstract}
  GraphZ is a distributed parallel graph processing system running on top of ZHT, a zero hop distributed hash table. It uses an itterative vertex-centric model to store a large graph and run a variety of algorithms over it. GraphZ has some performance issues, and cannot scale the same as graphlab, a similar commercial framework. We hope to rewrite GraphZ to be cometitive with Graphlab on a single node with multiple threads.
